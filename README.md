# Intel Extension for DeepSpeed
Intel Extension for DeepSpeed is an extension that brings Intel GPU (XPU) support to DeepSpeed(https://github.com/Microsoft/DeepSpeed).  It implements DeepSpeed Accelerator Interface as defined in https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/pull/2471.

Intel Extension for DeepSpeed comes with the following components:
1. DeepSpeed Accelerator Interface implementation
2. DeepSpeed op builders implmentation for XPU
3. DeepSpeed op builder kernel code

DeepSpeed would automatically use Intel Extension for DeepSpeed when it is installed as a python package.   After installation, models ported for DeepSpeed Accelerator Interface that run on DeepSpeed as in https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/pull/2471 could run on Intel GPU device.

Usage:
1. Install Intel Extension for DeepSpeed

`python setup.py install`

2. Install DeepSpeed
